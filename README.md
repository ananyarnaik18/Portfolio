# Portfolio
This is my personal developer portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It presents my technical skills, key web projects, and contact details in a modern dark-themed interface with interactive effects. The site demonstrates my frontend knowledge, UI sense, and readiness for freelance work, internships, and real-world web development roles.
